# UWP-PrimesApp

Generates primes. Is a UWP so can be downloaded from MS store. Bundle in releases tab should work as well, though.

Currently uses Win10 UI elements. Future update planned to bring this forward to Win11 UI elements, as well as some more substantial new features.

This will happen when I get time to make it happen.
